# CGR-BID-Columbia Academic Team

Welcome to our organization! We are an academic team composed of IADB, Columbia University and CGR research consultants supporting on _two main projects_

- The development of a set of Machine Learning Complaints algorithms
- An RCT to evaluate the quality of the "Monitores Ciudadanos" program

By clicking on a project name, you will access the user guide for the repositories related to each of them

## General Setup Guide

### Scripts setup
To set up the scripts locally, follow the next steps:

- Create two folders in your prefered path: `complaints_repos` and `mcc_repos`
- Within each folder, clone the respective repos. You can find a guide on cloning [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

### Databases setup
To set up your computer to access our data, follow this [guide](https://github.com/cgr-bid-columbia/odbc_setup_guide)

**Note:** While this README may be public, the guides regarding each project repos (as well as those repos) can only be seen by organization members.
